find.c: OOPS, turns out we get an infinite loop with the last commit...

We need to use a flag variable to change the flag we're playing with,
otherwise we keep going around and around.

No doubt there is a nicer way to fix this, but I'm not sure I completely
understand the original intention of the code, or its exact requirements.
