hid/gtk: Fix Pan action to stop after button release outside window

Previously, we required in-view coordinates to stop and start the
pan-action, and when the button was released outside the viewport,
the code was querying the user to click at a particular loacation.

Since the pan action doesn't even use the passed in coordinates,
simply remove the requirement for the x-y coordinates from this
action.

Closes-bug: lp-699307
