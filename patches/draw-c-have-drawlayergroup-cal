draw.c: Have DrawLayerGroup() call DrawPPV for non-gui exporters

This means DrawLayerGroup() can have a void return type as most of
the other drawing functions, and makes things a little neater.

Only the GUI renderers special case the pin / pad / via to wait
until a later rendering oass than the layers they reside on.
