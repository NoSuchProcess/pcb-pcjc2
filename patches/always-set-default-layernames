Always set default layernames for silk and mask layers

This avoids incorrect layernames being left over from our layer stack
should a board be loaded with missing layers (e.g. an old file format
board with no solder-mask layers).

XXX: Check what happens if we load a board with LOTS of defined layers
(more than our default layer stack), but has Layer() definitions missing!
Does it crash?
