Add raw polygons support for the GTK HID, bypassing the no-holes dicer

Uses the OpenGL stencil buffer to make drawing polygons with holes faster.

1. Turn Stenciling on, updates to colour buffer off
2. Clear stencil buffer to 0
3. Paint polygon holes, setting those areas of the stencil buffer to 1
4. Switch on stencil test (== 0), turn on updates to colour buffer
5. Paint outer polygon through areas of the stencil buffer still 0
6. Clear stencil buffer, switch off stencilling.

** BUGS? **

Probably throws up if the function is used whilst drawing the mask,
since that uses stenciling as well, and they don't know to co-operate.

For now, we don't use polygons on the mask, so its not a a problem (?).
(OR do we.. for some pins?)
