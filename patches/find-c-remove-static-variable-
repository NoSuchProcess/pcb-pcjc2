find.c: Remove file-global "IsBad", use PlowsPolygons() return value.

This variable was used to communicate state from the drc_callback(),
however PlowsPolygons() returns the sum of the values returned by its
callback function. As our callback returns 0 on success, 1 on DRC
failure, we know any non-zero return from PlowsPolygons() implies a
DRC problem.
