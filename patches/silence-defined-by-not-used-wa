Silence defined by not used warning for __r_tree_is_good

__r_tree_is_good() and its helper functions are only used when debugging,
and are called from assert() macros. If "NDEBUG" is defined, these expand
to nothing, and the function is not called.

Wrap __r_tree_is_good() and its helper, __r_tree_node_is_good() with
#ifndef NDEBUG
