hid/gtk: Add feature to force an immediate redraw if framerate is low

If more than a certain time (currently hard-coded at 50ms) has elapsed
since the last expose callback, invalidate_all() will wait and process
updates before returning.

This is handy to allow animation of auto-router progress, where the gui
mainloop is not hit until the auto-routing operation is fully complete.
