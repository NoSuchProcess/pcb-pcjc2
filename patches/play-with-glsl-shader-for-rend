Play with GLSL shader for rendering line caps and circles

And of course.. typically, a million other little fixes:

 - Primitive rendering object changed from GL_TRIANGLES to GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
 - Cache of tristrip data per contour (HACK: in the core)
 - Rendering using mapped VBOs rather than just arrays
 - Updated layer depth code, so we render with "z" in world coordinates
 - Space navigator joystick support fixes against later kernels

Bugs:
 - Layer depths will be wrong for reversed layer group numbering
 - Pixel shader ought to be switched off for polygon fill?
 - hidgl_draw_rect stubbed out (for benchmarking)
 - Draw Element mark stubbed out (for benchmarking)
 - Draw crosshair stubbed out (for benchmarking)
 - Draw crosshair not updated to render in world coordinates
