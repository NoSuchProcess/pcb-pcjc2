hid/gtk: Replace usage of the deprecated gtk_widget_set_uposition() call

The closest replacement is gtk_window_move(), and looking at the GTK
sources, appears to be what gtk_widget_set_uposition() calls internally.

We are still rather at the mercy of the user's window manager as to
whether it will honour the request we make, and arguably we ought to
remove this (mis-)feature anyway.
