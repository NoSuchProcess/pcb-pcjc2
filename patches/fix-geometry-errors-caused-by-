Fix geometry errors caused by commit 2d8dc8a3a3a55158b4e6278dd9f40588e4111c2d

This fixes up problems from the following commit:

    [PATCH] fix bug 2793480 (vias/arcs-to-polygon clearances)

    frac_circle(): introduce radius_adjustment factor to make
    the polygon outline the arc rather than connet points on the arc

    ArcPolyNoIntersect(): compute number of segments so that
    polygon diverges from the arc no more than 0.02 of
    required thickness; adjust outer "arc" radius like in frac_circle()

The object bounding boxes for arcs, vias, lines and rounded pads which
determine the maxiimum area affected by that object were no longer
correct, leading to artaefacts when doing incremental polygon processing.

It also lead to missing fragments in (the non-curved + and x type
thermals). These are also fixed up by this patch.
