Don't make GUI drawing calls to erase objects

Changing the colour here is unnecessary (as drawing is deferred).
Delete the gui->set_color() calls, and additionally, comment out
all real-time drawing frmo the autorouter. This hasn't been ported
to be compatible with the GL code, which requires specific setup
and teardown around drawing.
