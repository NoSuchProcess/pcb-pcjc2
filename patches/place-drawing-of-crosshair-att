Place drawing of crosshair attached objects under the control of the HID

This allows GUIs which have defined setup and tear-down requirements
before drawing to manage when these objects are drawn.

Expose some API from crosshair.c to perform the actual drawing on
demand, and add a hook to the HID structure to notify the GUI when
it would previously have called the drawing routines directly.
