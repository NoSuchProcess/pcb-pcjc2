Add support for filling / thindrawing raw polygons to the HID interface

Refactor core polygon drawing to use these member functions, and split
the old code which used the HID's fill_polygon and draw_line functions
into a helper function which the guis now use to convert the polygon
into the primitives it knows how to draw.
