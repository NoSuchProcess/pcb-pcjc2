toporouter.c: Make inline functions "static inline"

gcc builds break for CFLAGS="-g" only builds (no -O2). Inlineing is only
performed when optimisation is enabled, and unless we make all local
inlined functions "static inline", it does not emit the non-inlined
assembly for them, resulting in undefined symbols at link time.
