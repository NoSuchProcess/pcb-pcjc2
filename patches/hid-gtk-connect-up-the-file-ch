hid/gtk: Connect up the file-change monitor in a more sensible place

I must have had a brain-fail when I hooked it up in the call which sets
the window title. NB: That also gets called after every menu operation!

Hook up the connection in the ghid_sync_with_new_layout() function,
which looks to be a much more appropriate place.
