Fix thindraw mask drawing for pins, including octagonal ones

We need to set the line-width for round pins when in thin-draw and
clearing the mask.

We need to tell DrawSpecialPolygon() whether we need thin-draw or
not depending on whether we're clearing the mask or not. We don't
need to set the line-width outside of DrawSpecialPolygon(), since
it sets it its-self.

Fix DrawSpecialPolygon() to set the line width and cap style on the
correct GC.
