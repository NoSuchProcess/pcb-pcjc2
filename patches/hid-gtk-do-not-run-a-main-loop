hid/gtk: Do not run a main loop from within the netlist window code.

It turns out that this is a really bad idea.. if the main loop is kept
busy, the new main-loop never exits and the events can become reentrant.

I discovered this when testing code for an animation which used the main
event loop for its timing. Each time a node was selected in the netlist
window, stack-frame would grow - as the new nested main loops never
became idle. Segfaults ensued quite readily, presumably due to the code
not being designed to be reentrant.
