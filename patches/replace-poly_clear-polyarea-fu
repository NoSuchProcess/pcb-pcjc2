Replace poly_Clear(POLYAREA *) function with poly_FreeContours(PLINE **)

The poly_Clear function only clears the contours of the polygon anyway,
so make a more explicitly named function to do this work, and pass the
contours directly.

This will be useful should we want to deal with a series of contours
separately from a POLYAREA object.
