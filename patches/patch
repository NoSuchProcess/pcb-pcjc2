Replace {COMPONENT,SOLDER}_LAYER with {TOP,BOTTOM}_{SILK_LAYER,SIDE} depending on usage

We used the previous constants to identify board sides, as well as an offset
at the end of the layer array to find the silk-screen layers.

Split the usage to keep useage as a board SIDE integer and LAYER offset separate,
and update the old component/solder terminology.
