Attempt at supporting Mapped VBO / VBO / Arrays neatly

DARN: Seems that using VBOs is not a win, even on Intel 965.
Certainly seems to fail miserably (v. low FPS) on my NVidia card.

On Intel, sysprof shows a huge amount of time spent clflushing
buffers, or copying to the graphics card (uncached).

Set to use glBufferSubData by default for now.
