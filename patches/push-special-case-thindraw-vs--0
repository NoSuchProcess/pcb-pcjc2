Push special case thindraw vs. fill polygon handling into the GUIs

This keeps the API more consistent between polygons and other object
types by introducing the new (HID_DRAW *)->draw_pcb_polygon() API.

I've left the (HID_DRAW *)->{fill,thindraw}_pcb_polygon() APIs for
now, as it means we can avoid a little code duplucation between the
GUIs. We may consider removing (or hiding) these APIs at some point,
as they are now _NOT_ intended to be called from outside of the
GUI's (HID_DRAW *)->draw_pcb_polygon() implementation.
