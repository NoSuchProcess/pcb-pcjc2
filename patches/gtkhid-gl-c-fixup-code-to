Fixup code to determine whether we draw pins/vias on a given layer

The net change of this patch is that we consider whether to draw pins/vias
for each layer within the layer group. Previously, if we encoundered a layer
named "outline" or "route" within the layer group, all _subsequent_ layers
within that group would not have their pins/vias rendered.

As ordering of the layers within the group should not be important like this,
change behaviour to apply test on a per-layer basis.
