Rename "{component,solder}_silk_layer" to "{top,bottom}_silk_layer"

This will avoid confusion when we start adding "soldermask" layers.

The resulting variables solder_soldermask_layer and component_soldermask_layer
are not ideal (repeated use of the word solder), so lets start using "top_" and
"bottom_" to define the board sides. The corresponding new layer names are then
"top_soldermask_layer" and "bottom_soldermask_layer", which is less confusing.

Patch includes various other renaming of component -> top and solder -> bottom.
