Correct rendering of and connectivity checks for zero clearance pads and pins

NB: These areren't technically allowed by PCB, but it is nice that when a
user hacks zero clearance in their PCB file, that we:

a) Draw polygons without any cleared gaps in the output
b) Correctly determine that these objects will be connected to the polygon
