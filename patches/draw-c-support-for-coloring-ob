draw.c: Support for coloring objects with CONNECTEDFLAG set

We now color objects with the FOUNDFLAG set in the FoundColor, not the
ConnectedColor as we did previously. Unsurprisingly, objects with the
CONNECTEDFLAG set get rendered in the ConnectedColor.

CONNECTEDFLAG is tested before FOUNDFLAG, and takes precidence if an
object has both flags set.
