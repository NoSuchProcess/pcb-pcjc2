Add cache for board-outline

This adds a cache of the board outline, to improve rendering speed
when plotting the board with an outline.

The cache is invalidated when the "outline" or "route" layer is
updated. We catch this by bodging the ClearFromPolygon() routine,
which is called for almost all layer geometry changes which might
affect us.

XXX: We really need to add a nicer place to be notified of board
layer changes!
