Ensure "Gathering" mode is set after painting the screen.

In between repaints initiated from the GUI, with this flag set, all
Draw{object_type} operations just update a dirtied bounds. A final
Draw() call then calls the HID to invalidate the bounds gathered.

Setting "Gathering = True" after an expose event callback ensures
subsequent drawing is batched up for the next screen update.
