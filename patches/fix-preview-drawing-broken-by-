Fix preview drawing broken by resetting "Gathering" mode after painting.

Seems that the pinout preview widget relied on the bug fixed in commit
0647d028e6c755715d2fcdbd0b4f2be73d36ae7f. In the expose handler of the
preview, We should be calling the hid_expose_callback() function rather
than DrawElement() directly.
