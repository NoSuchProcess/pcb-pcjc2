Various speedups to the polygon code.

Avoid labelling the "A" polygon's contours, use the contour r-trees to
dynamically search the required data.

Add code to reparent holes which end up in the wrong polygon piece after
inserting a new hole in InsertHoles. (Means we don't have to dump every
potental hole we encounter in the holes insersion queue, hopefully leading
to better dynamic update performance.
