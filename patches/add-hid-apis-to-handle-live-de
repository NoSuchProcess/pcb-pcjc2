Add HID apis to handle live debug drawing from the core

It is envisaved that this API should ONLY be used for debugging, not
presenting a user-interface. In general, the GUIs may have their own
special requirements for drawing the board, and this API is not meant
to allow the core to augment or present user-visible drawing. This is
reflected in the API naming.

Request permission for debug drawing

HID *ddraw = gui->request_debug_draw (void);

Returns a HID pointer which should be used rather than the global
gui-> for making drawing calls. If the return value is NULL, then
permission has been denied, and the debug drawing must continue.


Flush pending drawing to the screen

void ddraw->flush_debug_draw (void);

May be implemented as a NOOP if the GUI has chosen to send the debug
drawing directly to the screen.


When finished, the user must inform the GUI to clean up resources:

ddraw->finish_debug_draw (void);

Any remaining rendering will be flushed to the screen.
