hidgl: Fixup signature gluTessCallback functions to work on Win32

On windows these callbacks are invoked using stdcall calling convention
and we need to annotate then with the "CALLBACK" macro to achieve this.

If we ever end up using glew.h, we can probably drop the #ifndef CALLBACK
check which #defines CALLBACK to an empty string on other platforms.
