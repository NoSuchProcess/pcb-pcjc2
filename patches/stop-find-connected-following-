Stop "find connected" following rat-lines. Fixes confusing output.

Suppose we have two nets, A and B, and some components. If we connect
a pin of a component which was supposed to be connected to net A, to
net B, the "f" (find connected) action will falsely show the entirity
of net A and net B connected to each other. In reality, the nets are
not electrically connected, it is just the ratline between the
mis-connected component pin (mis-connected to Net B), and net A,
where the ratline for that pin should end up.

It MIGHT be better if we fix this bug by not adding rat-lines to shorted
connections, as often those rat-lines would take some convoluted route
through the copper of the net which is shorted to that connection
end-point. These rat-line(s) would no longer be spatially associated
with the mis-connected wiring, and encourage the user to further short
net A and net B together to complete the ratline.

This bug was a contributing factor to a mistake in a production board
I made recently, where as a last step in production, I added a star-
ground short between two different ground planes (analogue and digital).
The "find connected" action, "f" showed them connected together (as I
expected), but unfortunately, due to a thermal I left out, they were not
actually connected - despite PCB's green rendering suggesting that they
were.
