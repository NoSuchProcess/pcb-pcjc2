Stop "find connected" following rat-lines. Fixes confusing output.

Suppose we have two nets, A and B, and some components. If we connect
a pin of a component which was supposed to be connected to net A, to
net B, the "f" (find connected) action will falsely show the entirity
of net A and net B connected to each other. In reality, the nets are
not electrically connected, it is just the ratline between the
mis-connected component pin (which is connected to Net B), and net A,
where the ratline for that pin should end up.

It MIGHT be better if we fix this bug by not adding rat-lines to shorted
connections, as often those rat-lines would take some convoluted route
through the copper of the net which is shorted to that connection
end-point. These rat-line(s) would no longer be spatially associated
with the mis-connected wiring, and encourage the user to further short
net A and net B together to complete the ratline.

This bug was a contributing factor to a mistake in a production board
I made recently, where there as a last step in production, I added a short
between two different ground planes (analogue and digital). The "find
connected" action, "f" showed them connected together (as I expected),
but unfortunately, due to a thermal I left out, they were not actually
connected - despite PCB's green rendering suggesting that they were.
