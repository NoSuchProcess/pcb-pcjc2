Add split colouring for "Find" action

Colour differently depending on whether objects are physically connected
to the object under the cursor when invoking the "Find" action.

The aim here is to differentiate between what an ohm-meter would show
connected with the board as-currently designed, and what it would read
if all rat-lines were implemented.
