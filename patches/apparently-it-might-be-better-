Apparently it might be better to do glVertexPointer last

From: http://sdickinson.com/wordpress/?p=122

""
Make sure you put glVertexPointer at the end as there is a lot of work that
goes on behind the scenes with it, and if it's set at the start, it has to
do all that work for each gl*Pointer call, rather than once at the end.
