Attempt to make PCB faster when working with polygons.

Currently, moving / altering objects can take far longer than the
time taken to clear _all_ polygons at startup. Incremental updates
seem to get bogged down. Can we instead:

Re-clear polygons from scratch for certain updates?
Use any more efficient algorithms for update?
