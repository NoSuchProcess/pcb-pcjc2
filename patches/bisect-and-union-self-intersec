Bisect and union self-intersecting arcs in ArcPoly()

Avoids creating a self-intersecting contour which produces incorrect
result. Bug noted when clearing a 360 degree arc from a polygon.

For self-intersecting arcs, we now bisect, produce two polygons (with
non-self-intersecting contours), then compute their union.
