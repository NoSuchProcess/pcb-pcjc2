hid/gtk: Free list returned from gtk_container_get_children()

We can (and should) g_list_free() the list of children returned when
we are finished with it.

Whilst we are at it, convert the while loop to a for loop and use a
tighter condition on the loop termination test. The existing test worked,
but would leave a negative number in the object counter we test against.
This would not work if the object counters were ever unsigned integers
(as they might plausibly be).

Fix this now so the style isn't copied elsewhere.
