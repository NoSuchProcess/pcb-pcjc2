hid/gtk: Allow zooming out past the board size (up to 1/5 viewport size)

Adds an explicit pan fixup to ghid_view_zoom_fit(), as this is no longer
clamped at the origin by pan_common().

It was also necessary to add a fixup for the stored gport->pcb_{x,y}
coordinates. Without this, if you zoomed in far enough to clamp against
the viewport edge, zooming out again would not produce the expected
result (backing out the zoom), as the clamping against the viewport
shifts the PCB coordinate under the mouse pointer, and hence the
required zoom center.
