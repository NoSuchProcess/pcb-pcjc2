configure.ac: Fixup some confusion between CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS

We were variously using CFLAGS for adding pre-processor includes to,
where these should end up in the CPPFLAGS variable. Confusingly, their
constituents tend to come from variables set by autoconf / pkgconfig
expansions in the form of LIBNAME_CFLAGs.

Also ensure that we save and restore CPPFLAGS when we modify it during
configure tests.
