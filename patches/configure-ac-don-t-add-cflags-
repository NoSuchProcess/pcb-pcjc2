configure.ac: Use CPPFLAGS, not CFLAGS for our include directives.

We were previously using CFLAGS for adding pre-processor includes, where
these should really end up in the CPPFLAGS variable. Confusingly, their
constituents tend to come from variables set by autoconf / pkgconfig
expansions in the form of LIBNAME_CFLAGS.

Doing this allows the user to easily override CFLAGS at build time without
needing to replicate the enture include path list.
