hid/gtk: Fix NetlistChanged action crash when exporting from the commandline.

I broke this in commit 7308f512307158944482227d58e66373fd023d62 when I
added a missing notification to the GUI when free'ing the netlist. It turns
out that a command-line invoked export (such as used to export images in the
doc/ build) will hit this code-path, and provoke the GUI netlist window code
to try and update before the GUI is actually loaded.
