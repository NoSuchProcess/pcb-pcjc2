find.c: Remove stray RestoreUndoSerialNumber() calls

These will cause havoc with the undo system, as we don't actually
save a serial number to restore to.

Until a commit efd212c1deb264e9a7f2be17e9338fbb60e22cc0 we were
saving a serial number at the start of each "ResetConnections (true);"
call, and it would have been that serial number which got restored.

With this and some other fixes to the undo system, these restores
are no longer required.
