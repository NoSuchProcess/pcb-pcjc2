hid/lesstif: Fix dropped crosshair artaefacts when dragging objects.

It seems that the idle_proc redraw code assumed the crosshair was
switched off upon entry, proceeding to redraw everything (and
obliterate the crosshair in the process). The final show_crosshair (1)
call only has any effect if the crosshair was notionally off before
hand.

As a quick work-around (you could probably do it with less flicker with
a little more logic), ensure the crosshair is turned off just prior to
redrawing the screen - so it will switch back on correctly afterwards.
