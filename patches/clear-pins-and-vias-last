Clear pins and vias last...

There is a chance these objects are simpler, and just end up as holes in
the main polygon, rather than causing a contour intersection. This means
it is cheaper to add them last.

If we add them first, and make the polygon complex, objects (usually
lines) which pierce the polygon's outer contour cause all the holes to
be removed and queued for re-insersion after the new contour is
constructed.
