gts: Avoid performing computations with side-effects in g_assert statements

g_assert (like assert), can be disabled at build time, so assertions
should therefore not contain any expressions which have side-effects.

Coverity caught a number of these in the copy gts library we have embedded,
fix them by separating the computation and the assertion test.
