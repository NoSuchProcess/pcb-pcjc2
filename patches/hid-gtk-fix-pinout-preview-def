hid/gtk: Fix pinout preview default zoom after unit conversion

Since this code is monumentally obtuse, just re-write something new. It
may have been bit-rotten a bit after splitting out the rendering widget.

Lets just suggest a fixed size of 100 pixels natural size for each 150 mil
of element bounding box. That seems to work nicely.
