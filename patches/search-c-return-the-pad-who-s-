search.c: Return the pad who's center is closest to the queried coordinate

When snapping to pads we often find the case where the search radius is
wider than the spacing between pads. SearchPadByLocation() previously
returned the first pad it found whthin the search area, meaning you could
have the crosshair right above a particular pad, yet snap to a different
pad due to it being within the search radius of the crosshair, and
happening to be tested first by the r-tree search code.

This proof of concept change makes SearchPadByLocation() return the pad
whos center coordinate is closest to the center of the search location.

This fixes another annoying snapping behaviour for some parts such as
"0805", when operating with a fairly course grid. (NB: Search radius
for snapping is related to the size of the current grid).
