draw.c: Fix mask drawing at high zooms (only draw the bit on-screen)

This probably papers over a bug in the GTK hid's fill_rect routine, as the
only reason this should fix anything is because it avoids coordinate overflow
at high zoom.

The GTK hid really ought to clip coords to the screen before transforming them
for rendering.
