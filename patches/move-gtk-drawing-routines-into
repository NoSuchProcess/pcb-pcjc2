hid/gtk: Move various gdk drawing routines into a new file gtkhid-gdk.c

This separates some of the drawing code so it could be replaced
more easily.

Pretty much a straight move at this point, but renamed the static
function "draw_grid()" to ghid_draw_grid() now it is no longer
local to gtkhid-main.

Removed all #include not required to build in gtkhid-main.c and
gtkhid-gdk.c
