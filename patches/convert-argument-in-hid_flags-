Convert argument in HID_Flags to (void *) rather than (int)

void * allows us to pass pointers on all platforms, 64bit or
otherwise. We can still use casting macros to safely pass integer
values via this pointer.

Silences compiler warnings on 64 bit build relating to the size
of field we're attempting to fit a size_t sized offset_of value
into. Due to the size of our structures, this did not cause
any actual bugs, but was not good practice.
