hid/gtk: Rest clip region for bg_gc, as it is used for expose events.

We set the clip region in the redraw_region() function to clip drawing
to the area which we intend to repaint, but we did not clear the clip
again.

This caused expose events to be clipped to the last redraw area rather
than the required damaged area.
