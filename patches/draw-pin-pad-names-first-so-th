Draw pin / pad names first, so they don't get masked by the pad

Since we use stencil masking to ensure we don't redraw an area
multiple times, confusingly, we need to draw the text first to
ensure it isn't occluded by the pad its-self.

HACK:

We probably draw the names multiple times - as we still use the
common draw.c code which assumes it can draw labels on top of
the pads.
