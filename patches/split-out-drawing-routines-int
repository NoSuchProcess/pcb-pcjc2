Push drawing routines into the HID_DRAW API for possible replacement

The aim here is to indirect calls to the various drawing routines such
that a GUI or renderer implementation may swap out different parts of
the rendering operation at will without having to re-implement the
entire drawing stack from scratch.

Each drawing API call will now be passed the drawing API structure as
its first parameter, so we don't rely on this being a global.

XXX: XXX: XXX: NO IT ISNT!!!

As a further clean-up, the graphics context being used by the rendering
routines is now a member of the vfunc table structure. We currently
retain the old Output.*gc members, but only use them (where necessary)
to update the ->gc member of the drawing API structure as rendering
progresses.
