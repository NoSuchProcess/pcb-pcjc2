Hack to make pretty translucent polygons in thindraw-poly mode

TODO: Perhaps need some way to configure this.. it might be nice in
non-thindraw mode too. If people want thin-draw to gain extra speed,
rather than have it actually slower (due to fill + outline), then a
way to turn it off would also be useful.
