action.c: Replace use of obsolete conversion macro TO_PCB with a constant.

This changes the location tolerance in NotifyLine()'s call to
LookupConnection() from what previously evaluated to 100 internal units,
to a constant of one internal unit.

This is consistent with other similar calls to LookupConnection(),
where it appears that a wide search area is not desired, so the smallest
possible value is passed.
