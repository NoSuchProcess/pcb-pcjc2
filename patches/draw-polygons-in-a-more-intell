Draw polygons in a more intelligent order

A sub-compositing stencil bit "S" is used to avoid overlapping polygons.

PASS 1a. Draw all non holed "SOLID" polygons which don't clear other
         geometry.

PASS 1b. Draw all "SOLID" polygons with holes.
         --
         In addition to "S", A second stencil bit, "H" is required for
         each of these polygons. Both are masked against. After each
         polygon drawn, a new "S" stencil bit is required.

PASS 2.  Mask out all clearance holes from other geometry.
         --
         As this is a polygon ONLY layer being subcomposited, this masking
         can be done directly on the "S" bit-plane.

PASS 3a. Draw all polygons which only feature clearance holes
PASS 3b. Draw all polygons which have user-defined holes.
         --
         In addition to "S", a second stencil bit, "H" is required for
         each of these polygons. Both are masked against. After each
         polygon drawn, a new "S" stencil bit is required.

NB: In this version. PASS 2 and 3 are carried out concurrently, although
    for boards with heavily overlapping polygons, it may be faster to
    mask out clearance for everything at once.
