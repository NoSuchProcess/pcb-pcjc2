Draw polygons in a more intelligent order

Require a sub-compositing bit to avoid overlapping polygons. Call this "S"

PASS 1a. Draw all non holed "SOLID" polygons which don't clear other
         geometry.

PASS 2b. Draw all "SOLID" polygons with holes. A SECOND stencil bit, "H"
         is required for each of these polygons (in addition to "S").
         After each polygon drawn, flag that a new stencil bit is required.

PASS 2.  Mask out all clearance holes from other geometry. As this is a
         polygon ONLY layer being subcomposited, this masking can be
         done directly on the "S" bit-plane.

PASS 3a. Draw all polygons which only feature clearance holes
PASS 3b. Draw all polygons which have user-defined holes.
         A SECOND stencil bit, "H" is required for each of these polygons
         (in addition to "S"). After each polygon drawn, a new "S"
         stencil bit is required.
