src/Makefile.am: Don't need to set AM_CFLAGS to C_OR_CXX_FLAGS

We were duplicating command-line flags un-necessarily, and it does not
stop the a build with the C++ compiler using CFLAGS, as was (in hindsight)
the original intention before commit 72cdf2ecef3361a00fbd0ee3e540f7383e62272c

We should not override CFLAGS in a Makefile as it prevents the user from
setting CFLAGS at "make" time, so I'm removing this completely.
