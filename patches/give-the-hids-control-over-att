Give the HIDs control over "attached" object redrawing (crosshair etc..)

This is required if the HID doesn't want to follow the current drawing
model where it is assumed the core can call the HID's drawing APIs at
any arbitrary point in time.

Expose some API from crosshair.c to perform the actual drawing on
demand, and add a hook to the HID structure to notify the GUI when
it would previously have called the drawing routines directly.

This allows GUIs which have defined setup and tear-down requirements
around drawing to execute them before the objects are drawn.

FIXME: This patch got rather out of hand, and has broken various things..
