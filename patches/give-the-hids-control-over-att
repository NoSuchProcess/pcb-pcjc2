Give the HIDs control over attached object (crosshair, mark) drawing

This is required if a renderer doesn't want to follow the current
drawing model where it is assumed the core can call the HID's
drawing APIs at any arbitrary point in time.

Expose some API from crosshair.c to perform the actual drawing on
demand, and add hooks to the HID structure to notify the GUI when it
would previously have called the crosshair or mark drawing routines.

This allows renderers with defined setup and tear-down requirements
around drawing to execute them before the objects are drawn.

CrosshairOn() and CrosshairOff() now simply set the Crosshair.On flag
and call the appropriate notification hooks.

This commit replaces all HideCrosshair() and RestoreCrosshair() calls
with the new hooks notify_{crosshair|mark}_changed(), with an argument
specifying whether a change is about to happen (false argument), or has
been completed (true argument).
