hid/gtk: Focus file save dialog at exit to "Save", not "Close without saving".

Avoids inadvertently loosing work when closing the application. "Cancel" would
also be a safe choice of default focus, but the choice of "Save" is copied from
gedit to help give better platform consistency on Gnome systems.
