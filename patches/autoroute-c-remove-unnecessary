autoroute.c: Remove unnecessary call to ResetConnections()

This is not required to call CollectSubnets, (as the rats.c internal
function GatherSubnets() cleans the flag from objects before it uses
it).

We also use DRCFLAG to mark nets in CreateRouteData(), however:

1. We should be able to assume the DRCFLAG is clear on all objects at the
   point we un-necessary to reset it.

2. We call GatherSubnets() after we reset the DRCFLAG contents, and
   that leaves the objects in a clean state without that flag set.
