hid/gtk: (GL Renderer) Use direct rendering for off-screen pixmaps

We use direct rendering for the rest (where possible), so why slow down
pixmap rendering. Also fixes a bug on my pcb+gl_experimental branch
where pixel shaders can't be shared between the direct rendered widgets
and the pixmap rendering code.
