drc: Fix line <-> polygon and polygon <-> polygon tests tests

In src/find.c, the one polygon is tested against a series of bloated
lines following the outline of the second polygon.

In IsPolygonInPolygon() we have:

  line.Thickness = 2 * Bloat;

But the test which is called, IsLineInPolygon()

Also adds bloat to the line:

  lp = LinePoly (Line, Line->Thickness + Bloat)

This bloat is actually half the size we should be adding for this
test, as the LinePoly argument is a line thickness, not cap radius.

Fix this all by doubling the bloat added in IsLineInPolygon(), and
set line.Thickness = 0; in IsPolygonInPolygon().
