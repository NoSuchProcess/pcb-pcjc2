FIXME: FULLY OF NASTY API HACKS TO draw.c

Notes from squashed patches:
  Pin and via hole cores are drawn in the appropriate colour
  Playing with stack rendering order
  Fix mask display in 3D (Allow both side masks to display at once)
  Fix rendering depths for silk and mask layers
  Fixup depth for layers and element marks
  Move more rendering to world coordinates
