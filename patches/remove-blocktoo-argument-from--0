Remove BlockToo argument from various crosshair hide / restore functions

Goodness knows what it is supposed to do, but everything appears to work
fine without it. For the majority of cases, the argument passed is true.

When passed as false, the effect is to surpress drawing an attached
selection / rubberband rectangle in the AttachedBox.state == STATE_THIRD
state.

Digging through the version control history, this code appears to have
been present since the project was initially placed under CVS control.

The 23 places this argument was previously false are:

    ActionMovePointer
        -  HideCrosshair (false);
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    EventMoveCrosshair
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    ActionDisplay
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    ActionFreeRotateBuffer
        -  HideCrosshair(false);
        -  RestoreCrosshair(false);
    MoveCrosshairAbsolute
        -  HideCrosshair (false);
    ghid_invalidate_all
        -  RestoreCrosshair (FALSE);
    ScrollAction (GTK HID)
        -  HideCrosshair (FALSE);
        -  RestoreCrosshair (FALSE);
    ghid_port_ranges_changed
        -  HideCrosshair (FALSE);
    ghid_note_event_location
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    idle_proc (Lesstif HID)
        -  CrosshairOn (0);
    CenterDisplay
        -  RestoreCrosshair(false);
    ReportDialog
        -  HideCrosshair (false);
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    ReportFoundPins
        -  HideCrosshair (false);
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    ReportNetLength
        -  HideCrosshair (false);
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
    SetLocalRef
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
        -  HideCrosshair (false);
        -  RestoreCrosshair (false);
