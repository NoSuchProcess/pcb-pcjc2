Fix broken undo handling for ResetFound*() and ResetConnections()

Many callers have this idiom:

  SaveUndoSerialNumber ();
  ResetFoundPinsViasAndPads (AndDraw);
  RestoreUndoSerialNumber ();
  ResetFoundLinesAndPolygons (AndDraw);

The intent is to squash the two operations into one undo operation. The
ResetFound* functions DO increment the Undo serial number but ONLY if
that particular function makes a change.

Assume for the example that the first ResetFound* call makes some change
and increments the serial number. This is then reset by the caller. If
the second ResetFound* call doesn't find anything, there is no overall
increment to the serial number.

Move the undo serial number handling out of the ResetFound* calls, and
let the callers increment the serial number if desired. To facilitate
this, return a boolean value from these functions to indicate whether
any changes were made which could be undone.

Add an additional argument to the Reset* functions separating conditional
execution of drawing updates and undo related processing.

For convenience, expose previously static find.c function
ResetConnections() in order to avoid repeating Undo handling in each
caller to the two ResetFound* functions which are often called together.
