draw.c: Fix damage area computation

We should reset the left and top bounds to MAXINT, and the right and
bottom bounds to -MAXINT. This way the correct bounds are computed
when gahering.

The code previously every coordinate to 0, meaning that the box
encompasing (0, 0)  up to the (max_x, max_y) would be invalidated,
rather than (min_x, min_y) to (max_x, max_y).
