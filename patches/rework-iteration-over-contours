Rework iteration over contours in "intersect" to improve performance

We don't need to be using an r_tree search to determine if a contour's
bounding box hits anything in another contour. Just compare the bounding
boxes directly, then continue to the more expensive testing.

Rather than counting the vertices of each POLYAREA then swapping to
ensure we loop over the the small one, wait until we've worked out
which contours we're comparing. Rather than swapping, we just choose
which to loop over. This saves us time in the case where the larger
intersecting contour belongs to the polygon with fewer vertices.
