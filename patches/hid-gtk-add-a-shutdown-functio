hid/gtk: Add a shutdown function to the renderer backends

This will be necessary to stop any event handlers / timers which
should not fire as the GUI is being shut down.

This code isn't actually very "live" at the moment, as the place I've
hooked up its trigger (the destroy event of the main window), doesn't
actually appear to get called.

This seems to be because the core "Quit" action just kills the program
dead, rather than attempting to shut down the GUI.
