hid/gerber: Remove option for thickness of auto-generated outline layer

We don't mess with the thickness of the user's hand-drawn outline, and
this option implies that we do. I cannot think of a sensible way to
present the option without confusing the user, so lets remove it.
10mil is a sensible default.
