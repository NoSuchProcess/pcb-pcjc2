autoroute.c: Simplify some long if statements

In a couple of cases, almost all the processing logic was burried inside
an if statement checking for validity of this processing pass. Re-organise
to test for an invalid condition, then "continue;" the loop if that is hit.

This reduces the nesting of some rather complex functions.
