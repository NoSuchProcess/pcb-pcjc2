undo.c: Handle undo failures in a more sane manner

Our current error-case handling can cause serial number inconsistency
when something goes wrong when performing an Undo operation. There are
also various logic flaws in our handling, as it only catches failures
where every sub-undo operation with that serial number fails.

Remove the confusing do-loop which decrements the serial number in the
failure case, and return some sensible error message instead.
