parse_y.y: Try to avoid two shift/reduce and reduce/reduce warnings

TODO: Check this matches up against our expected behavior.

Removing the parsedata section ("I think") has no effect, as elements
hit the alternative | element clause within parsepcb.

HOWEVER... I need to check whether there is any other valid syntax
inside an element file, or any backwards compatibility with old formats
which we may miss with the loss of parsedata.
