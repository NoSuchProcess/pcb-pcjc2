hid/gtk: Avoid warnings when netlist window is not created.

1. When the NetlistChanged action is fired, we should only update if the
   netlist window is visible. (It will be created up to date when the
   user asks for it).

2. Always show the netlist window when requested, even if it has no
   entries. This is good for consistent UI behaviour anyway, as the user
   should be shown a blank netlist window if they request it.. even if
   the is no content to display.
