Move some fields from the HID* structure to HID_DRAW* and HID_DRAW_CLASS*

The parameters gui, poly_before, poly_after only effect rendering, so
belong in either the HID_DRAW_CLASS or HID_DRAW instance structure.

The set_layer() and end_layer() APIs also belong in the HID_DRAW_CLASS

We leave a copy of the "gui" flag in the HID structure, as main.c uses
this to count up each type of exporter.
