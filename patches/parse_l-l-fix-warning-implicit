parse_l.l: Fix warning implicit definition of function ‘CreateBeLenient’

Fixes warning introduced in commit e8dd18a2f7b83c6108d2c9398903d4be92e22d4c

Prototype was added to create.h, but create.h was not included in parse_l.l

Note to developers:

Please "make clean" and build with "make -s" before pushing changes.
This kind of bug is really easy to catch, and I just recently spent
a log of effort cleaning up PCB's compile so we can catch real bugs!
