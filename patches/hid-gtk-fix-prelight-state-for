hid/gtk: Fix prelight state for layer button to show current status

One of the ways we identify whether a layer is switched on or off is
by changing the background colour of the GtkToggleButton representing
that layer.

Fix the prelight (mouse-over) background style to match the current
button state, so as to give immediate feed-back when the user presses
the button, and make the interface less confusing.
