Add leaky_{malloc,realloc} functions for deliberate non-free'd allocations

These are to be used for local allocations made and cached for
the lifetime of the program (never free'd). Typically, these are stored
in a static char * variable (or similar) within a function.

The leaky_*() functions store the addresses of all memory they allocate,
and for debugging builds, free it upon exit of the program, thus allowing
leak detectors such as valgrind to ignore our deliberate "leaks".
