Add leaky_{malloc,realloc} functions for deliberate non-free'd allocations

These are to be used for allocations made and deliberately cached
for the lifetime of the program. The leaky_*() functions store the
addresses of all memory they allocate, and for debugging builds,
free it upon exit of the program, thus allowing leak detectors such
as valgrind to ignore our deliberate "leaks".
