Refactor application of the default hidnogui HID handlers.

Replace usage of apply_default_hid() just prior to registering a HID
with an early call to the new common_nogui_init() function which pre-
applies the defaults, rather than post-replacing NULL handlers.

As this was the last user of the apply_default_hid() function,
remove it. Good riddance to yet another place which had to be updated
every time a new HID member was added.

The default nogui HID is now constructed explicitly by a call to
nogui_hid_get_hid (), which is called from hid_init(). This is
different to the other HIDs, as the nogui "hid" is never explicitly
registered.
