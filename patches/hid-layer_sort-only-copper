hid/*: layer_sort()  Only copper layers participate in the layer stack

Don't consider the layers greater than or equal to max_copper_layer,
ie.. Silk layers are not in the layer stack. Actually, don't even
worry about checking the layer is a copper layer - it will be.

Use GetLayerGroupNumberByNumber() directly, there is no need to worry
about being passed strange layer numbers.

Rename layer_sort() to layer_stack_sort(), reflecting our (new) preconditions.
