Add support for a "poured" object.

This takes half of the existing polygon functionality, and splits it
such that the user defines a poured region (similar to drawing a polygon
previously), and after clipping, this produces zero or more polygon
objects which are drawn and connectivity checked with the existing
polygon code.

Selecting a "polygon" will cause the parent "pour" to be looked up, and
all child polygons selected. Manipulations will always occur on the
"pour", with "polygons" being updated after clipping.

It remains to be seen whether "pour" will have its own file-format entry,
or if it will take over the meaning of the existing "polygon" entry.
