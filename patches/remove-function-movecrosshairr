Remove function MoveCrosshairRelative()

All the callers were actually just trying to re-fit the
same crosshair location into the grid / board area, so
ended up just calling FitCrosshairIntoGrid with the current
crosshair location.

Move this call directly into the two callers of
MoveCrosshairRelative(), and remove the latter.
