hid/gtk: Remove auto-pan feature (kill it with fire).

This seems to be fairly universally unpopular on geda-user, and its
implementation is a little fragile, often leading the board to pan off
to some corner of the board as the poor user reaches for the layer
selector or a menu without having remembered to click the feature off.

The fact that the pan direction and speed was set the instant you leave
the drawing window also made it particularly unhelpful. A proper
implementation should have grabbed the mouse - or at least implemented
some buffer zone in which the mouse could be used to give feedback on
the pan direction.
