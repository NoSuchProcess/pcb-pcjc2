hid/gtk: Update file-changed notification bar to match gedit a bit more

  1. Add a stock "refresh" image to the "Reload" button.
  2. Change the message text when the board has modifications.
  3. Reload without further prompting if the user presses "Reload",
     even if the board is modified. (We already warned them due to 2.)
