We don't need the RatFindHook to save undo state

We already save undo information to get to a known state when
resetting the FOUND flags. Since we later reset back to this state,
we don't need to save undo data.

Since all callers would pass false for the "undo" parameter after
this fix, remove it from the function prototype.
